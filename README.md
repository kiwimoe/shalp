## shalp
Esolang like ~~programming~~ language, which process small hand alphabets.

## Usage
Compile it through your compiler, I did with GCC (should support TCC).\
Note: Compilers like watcom have different rules on C, as result, watcom may not be comfortable for it.
```sh
# generate encoded output file
[prog] m test.txt test.out
```
```sh
# run and get stdout on TTY
[prog] r test.out
```
## Example
- Input context
```
this is an example file.
```
- Output (stdout)
```
"$x[=x[=qs=_<q!aw_=lxw_@
```
#### Have fun.
